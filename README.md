# ChatClient üó®Ô∏è

This project is the final part of a homework from **UFMS**.  
I used this opportunity to learn **Golang** and explore how to build a simple terminal-based chat client.

## üß© About the Project

This is a simple TUI (Text User Interface) chat client written in Go.  
It allows you to:
- Swap between two screens using **Tab**.
- Navigate between groups or create a new one using the **"a"** key.
- Type any message, including non-ASCII characters and emojis.

Example:
